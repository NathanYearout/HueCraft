HueCraft is a Minecraft mod that seamlessly integrates your Philips Hue lights with the game, allowing you to synchronize the lighting in your physical environment with the in-game brightness. Experience the game in a new immersive way as your room dynamically changes while you're in a dark cave or in a brightly lit base.

## Features

- **Real-time Lighting Synchronization**: The mod establishes a connection between your Philips Hue lights and Minecraft, ensuring that the brightness of your physical lights matches the in-game lighting in real-time.

- **Fast**: Unlike some mods this mod is designed to be responsive while still keeping FPS in mind. It does not capture the screen in order to achieve it's calculations resulting in a quicker experience.
  
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to use and setup and can automatically connect at launch.

- **Day/night Cycle Support**: Uses calculations to enable simulated sun and moon brightness.
